Created during Global Game Jam 2024.  

Basic Premise is a shooter with enemies that are integer numbers in decimal format, 
player collects 0s and 1s into their 'gun', and once the gun has the equivalent binary value of the enemy,
the player can 'shoot' and destroy the enemy. 

First game jam/ first time using a game engine. ^_^
